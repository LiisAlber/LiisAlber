## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently focused on mastering **Symfony**, a robust framework that's sharpening my back-end development skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also learning **PHP** and **JavaScript** to complement my Symfony projects and broaden my full-stack capabilities.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **open-source PHP and Symfony projects**. I'm enthusiastic about contributing to community-driven projects and learning from the collective.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with **advanced Symfony concepts** and **best practices** in web development.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love outdoor activities and find coding inspiration while hiking through nature!
